### Some "Request Methods" explanations

#### HEAD

> The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content

#### TRACE

> The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.

#### OPTIONS

> The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.

#### CONNECT

> The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.
